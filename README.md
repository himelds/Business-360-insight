## 🏢 About the Company

**AtliQ Hardware** is a rapidly growing global business that sells computers and computer accessories through three primary channels:

- 🛒 **Retailers**  
- 📦 **Distributors**  
- 🔗 **Direct Sales**

Despite its international expansion, the company faced a major setback after launching stores in the United States based on intuition, limited surveys, and basic Excel analysis. Competitors, equipped with strong analytics teams, were making far more informed decisions.

As a result, AtliQ Hardware decided to invest in building a dedicated **analytics team** to adopt a data-driven decision-making approach and maintain competitiveness in the hardware market.

- Build a centralized and interactive analytics dashboard using Power BI  
- Provide detailed, role-specific insights for departments including Sales, Finance, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executives
